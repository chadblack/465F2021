## Week 2 -- History and Theory I

Tuesday, August 24, 2021

We start this week by examining assumptions we often make about the
relationship between the past and the present. It is not uncommon for people to
imagine the present as better than the past, particularly given the rapid
technological changes of the last 150 years. Walter Benjamin asks us to examine
such assumptions, that History is a story of progress, as well as what the
obligations of the present are to the past. This is a curious reading. Treat it
like a puzzle, and see if you can unlock Benjamin's claims.

**Read:**

* Walter Benjamin, “Theses on the Philosophy of History,” Illuminations (New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2019).

Bring to class a list of categories and concepts divided into two columns:
HISTORICISM and HISTORICAL MATERIALISM. As you read Benjamin’s text, add any
concepts, keywords, or categories to one of these two columns. Historicism here
is what Benjamin associates with progress, history-as-progress, etc.

* Joan Wallach Scott, "Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis" *The
  American Historical Review* 91, no. 5 (1986): 1053-075.

As you read this article, consider how Scott defines gender. Is gender as
a category of historical analysis essentially women's history? If not, how does
it differ? Take notes on the reading and be ready to discuss in class.


## Week 3 -- History and Theory II

This week we will continue thinking about larger historical questions in
