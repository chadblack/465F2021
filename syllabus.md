circumstances directly found, given and transmitted from the past.

Scholars and activists frequently claim that the current status of women in
Latin America stems from a colonial legacy of gender oppression and sexual
repression. And yet, the status of women has changed substantially, not always
for the better, since the colonial period. Similarly, sexuality in the colonial
period contradicts modern notions of an evolution of sexual constraints
constructed through public and private divisions of social space.  This course
examines the sources, methodologies, and theoretical approaches that shape the
history of women and sexuality in early Latin America. The readings represent
ethnic, racial, and class-based distinctions among women and emphasize the
importance of using diverse approaches in the reconstruction women’s history
and culture, particularly for indigenous and African women. The course ends
with an analysis of how female figures from the colonial period, such as La
Malinche and the Virgin of Guadalupe, have been incorporated into modern
political agendas by intellectuals and political activists. Students will read,
analyze, and discuss both primary and secondary sources to understand how
history is conceived and written. 


course objectives
-----------------

1.  To introduce the students to the concept of gender and its usefulness and
    limitations to the study of history. In problematizing that term, students
    will investigate the relationship between historically specific categories
    of domination and lived experience.

2.  To understand sexuality as a historical process.

3.  To help students better understand the relationship between important
    historical concepts such as agency and structure, culture and power.

4.  To help students understand some historical approaches to asking and
    answering questions, including: How to identify, closely read, and analyze
    primary sources. How to work with and evaluate useful secondary sources,
    specifically identifying and evaluating their central arguments. How to
    work with non-written sources (including images and artifacts).

5.  To understand and appreciate ambiguity in historical argument
    and presentation.

# policies


![](http://chadblack.net/511S2012/media/images/disability.png) Qualified
students with disabilities needing appropriate academic adjustments should
contact me as soon as possible to ensure that your needs are met in a timely
manner with appropriate documentation.

**Masks:** The University is currently requiring students, faculty, and staff
to mask indoors. We will comply with this requirement. The Delta variant of
this virus is extremely contagious, with an R0 somewhere [between
5-9](https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/CDC-says-the-delta-variant-is-as-contagious-as-16356370.php) (one person will infect
on average 5-9 people). This turns a classroom of 100+ people into
a potentially high-risk situation. Wearing a mask for 75 minutes indoors is
a small price to pay to be back in University community.

**Attendance:** Attendance is mandatory. If you cannot attend, please email
Dr. Black or your TA ahead of time. We're not making an Inquisition into your
absences, so the reasons you can't attend are not as important as giving us the
heads up. If you have *any* symptoms or have been exposed to COVID, please do
not come to class! Just send is a quick email, and get tested.


**Deadlines:** Assignments must uploaded to Canvas by the end of the day on
which they are due. Late papers will not be accepted with out **prior
arrangement**. If you will not be able to complete an assignment on time, you
must contact me and your TA ahead of time. If you contract COVID or some other
illness, please let us know so that we can work with you.


**Cell Phones, Laptops, Zoom:** Cellphones should be put away during class.
Please do not text or post to the Group Me during class. It is very distracting
to people around you, and to the professor. Laptops may be used to take notes,
but I would ask you to seriously consider using paper instead. If you want or
need to use a laptop, please consider sitting towards the back of the room so
as to minimize distractions behind you. If we have to utilize Zoom at some
point, please practice the kind of respectful manners that I'm sure you have
become used to over the last 15 months. In class and on Zoom, I would invite
you to interrupt me with questions during lecture.

Research shows that analog note-taking improves learning. Consider having paper
with you. Based on the prevailing literature, hand note-taking-- both while
reading and in class-- leads to substantially better educational outcomes.
Consider taking notes by hand even though you'll be watching on your computer.


**Drop-in Hours**: Students are strongly encouraged to speak with me and the
TAs outside of class. The advantages include: extra help on an assignment
or preparation for exams; clarification of materials covered in lecture,
discussion of comments on your work; discussion of this or related courses.
I have an open door policy during my drop-in hours. I will be there, and you
are welcome to come by for any reason. Your TAs have the same.

**Changes:** I reserve the write to change this syllabus as the semester
progresses. This is not a contract, but rather a document to guide expectations
and clearly communicate weekly assignments. Please bring the syllabus with you
to our class meetings. Or, keep up with it on the course website. We'll have to
remain flexible as the outlook for our fourth pandemic semester is still
uncertain.
